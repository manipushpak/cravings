                  Chilimango wants to connect you to local, cheap and delicious food! Our mission is to support the local community and with street vending decriminalized, we want to introduce you to food that was previously hidden in the shadows.
                  <br /><br />
                  The goal of our platform is to connect Angelenoâ€™s and tourists to the local food scene. Street food is tied to the fabrics and diversity of Los Angeles and we would like you to get a taste of authentic LA.
